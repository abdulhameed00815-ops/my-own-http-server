ok, so now my server uses async io to handle requests with concurrency, i stress tested it and it handled a 1000 requests with 500 concurrent ones, once i up the number to 10000 and 500 concurrent the server starts to suffer from partial reads bec of stress, but for me this is pretty acceptable performance. (update: i tested the server from my gaming rig and it hit 16k requests with 1000 concurrent, the next step is to grow the server horizontally, prolly allowing for dynamic requests to user-made endpoints this time)
