okay, so my method of making functions handle http requests was: store the function in a string, then send that string to the server and it should find a way around it, but thats very dumb, because what if the function needs params, what if i want to make the url params as the function params, if i really want to replicate fastapi then i would have to change my server.create_endpoint completely, i ll have to make a function decorator that takes its params and set it to the actual endpoint url params, the part that i dont understand is, how could we collect the result of the function, this is the part that didnt yet click. (update) ok, so the problem that we werent aware of, is that the path of the endpoint consists of two things, constant path values, and variable ones, the variable ones are the ones that should be used as a param for the endpoint funciton when we get to execute it, to differentiate between them, so one thing that we know for sure is, that the constant always comes before the variables, the problem is, how to parse these multiple or single variables properly. (update): so, i gotta change the plan, i gotta make another class for creating routes, and these routes will live in the memory and will be accessible by the handler once a request comes in.
