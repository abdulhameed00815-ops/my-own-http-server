ok, so now my server uses async io to handle requests with concurrency, i stress tested it and it handled a 1000 requests with 500 concurrent ones, once i up the number to 10000 and 500 concurrent the server starts to suffer from partial reads bec of stress, but for me this is pretty acceptable performance. (update: i tested the server from my gaming rig and it hit 16k requests with 1000 concurrent, the next step is to grow the server horizontally, prolly allowing for dynamic requests to user-made endpoints this time)
(update: these are my thoughts before today's session 16-02-2026, okay, so i have a good performing server, which is a good base to build upon, now what i want to do is to make it look for custom, user-created endpoints, for that to happen i will need to have another python file, and import the server constructor class, and then the user should be able to create a endpoint with a specific url shape, and a specific piece of code that gets run whenever this endpoint is called and returns a value to our server, also let us not forget that this endpoint has to run all of the code asyncronously, that all is not required to happen today, i might break it into smaller chuncks, maybe today i have to find a way to import this class from another file in the same directory, and also edit my class constructor to firstly check for the added endpoints (which we will handle later), if not it should return a 404 instead of a generic response, this all, ofc in case the request is dynamic (which we already have handled before).)
